# Computer_Organization_Project_2
With my teammates [Hakan](https://github.com/Hakan-Duran) and [Emre](https://github.com/emre-camlica) we made a simple CPU system in this project. 

Instructions are stored in the memory and with a hard-wired control system, these instructions are used to execute operations in our ALU system which was made in [Project 1](https://github.com/mymermer/Computer_Organization_Project_1).
