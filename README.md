# Computer_Organization_Project_2
In this project, we made a simple CPU system. 

Instructions are stored in the memory and with a hard-wired control system, these instructions are used to execute operations in our ALU system which was made in [Project 1](https://github.com/mymermer/Computer_Organization_Project_1).

[More information and requirments of the project](CORG_Project_2_Requirments.pdf)

[Detailed explanation of our implementations](report/main.pdf)

Need to also mention that working alongside [Yusuf](https://github.com/mymermer) was an absolute pleasure.
